# A project to investigate "mainlandisation" of Hong Kong's government's speeches and remarks

As the Hong Kong protests continued to develop in 2019, the government increasingly became vocal to speak against the protests. Officials said this was an effort to counter the "propaganda" put out by the protesters. And as Beijing also became more vocal against the protests, Hong Kong govenrment also continued to spdak against it, but apparently used more and more political lingo previously seen only in the mainland. 

After the protests came the coronavirus. Chinese government requests and support poured in, and to show their gratitude, Hong Kong officials against spoke in those political lingo. 

In February 2022, I started collecting speeches and remarks made by Hong Kong officials, as well as statements from the government. We theorised the trend largely started only during the protests in 2019, but the collection of our data dated way back to July 2012 - when former Chief Executive CY Leung took office - for comparison.
