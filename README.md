# A project to investigate "mainlandisation" of Hong Kong's government's speeches and remarks

As the Hong Kong protests continued to develop in 2019, the government increasingly became vocal to speak against the protests. Officials said this was an effort to counter the "propaganda" put out by the protesters. And as Beijing also became more vocal against the protests, Hong Kong govenrment also continued to spdak against it, but apparently used more and more political lingo previously seen only in the mainland. 

After the protests came the coronavirus. Chinese government requests and support poured in, and to show their gratitude, Hong Kong officials against spoke in those political lingo. 

In January 2022, we started collecting speeches and remarks made by Hong Kong officials, as well as statements from the government. We theorised the trend largely started only during the protests in 2019, but the collection of our data dated way back to July 2012 - when former Chief Executive CY Leung took office - for comparison.

## Method

We built a list of phasesd commonly used by Chinese officials based on remarks during Chinese foreign ministry's daily press conference. Then we analysed quantitatively how often these phases appeared in Hong Kong government speeches and remarks and divided the results in terms of months. 

We found that
* We found that Hong Kong officials increased their use of phases such as "so-called", "ulterior motives" and so on - often in the same way Chinese officials would use them. 
* Some phases describing cross-border issues that have been in common use before and after the 1997 handover have also been modified to emphasise Hong Kong's status as a local administrative divison of China.
* The same phenomenon can be observed in remarks and statement released in both the Chinese and English-language. But it is particularly noticable in Chinese. 

## Interview and quotes

* Bumgi Min, a PhD candidate from the College of Communication at the Pennsylvania State University in the US. He has been studying Chinese govermment propaganda style. 
* Luqiu Luwei, an assistant professor from the Baptist University of Hong Kong. She has been studying the changing of Hong Kong government's language styles before and after the handover.
